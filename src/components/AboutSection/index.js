                            Hi! I'm Joanna, I'm a full-stack web developer and designer. I spent
                            the last five years of my career in retail design, working for Urban Outfitters as a Market
                            Display Artist. My career in
                            design has taught me how to learn quickly, creatively solve problems, and build
                            customer-focused spaces that are both functional and visually engaging.
                            It's my passion for creating that made me fall in love with web development ever since my
                            very first "Hello World".
                        <br /><br />
                            Currently, I'm finishing up a Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp through the University of
                            Washington, where I am learning to convert my skills in building physical spaces, to
                            building impactful user experiences on
                            the web. I hope to transition into web development as a full time career, and am open to any
                            and all opportunities. I am excited about merging my background in design with my newly
                            developed technical skills, to build both useful and beautiful things on the web.
